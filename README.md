# dotfiles
This is my Linux setup. Every folder except "windows" is managed using GNU Stow.

## How To Install
* Clone this repo directly to your home folder.
* Install GNU Stow
* Delete/rename/move the real dotfile you want to install
* `cd` to this repo
* Run command `stow <folder>`
* Watch as stow create symlink to your dotfiles

**NOTE: THIS README IS NOT A TUTORIAL HOW TO USE GNU STOW. FOR BEST PRACTICE, SEEK OTHER TUTORIAL. THIS README IS JUST A REMINDER FOR MYSELF.**
